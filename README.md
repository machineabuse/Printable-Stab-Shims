# Printable-Stab-Shims
Printable stabilizer shims for your thin keyboard PCB

## Description
This repository holds a handful of .STLs for stabilizer shims for various situations. If you need just a basic shim to go on top of the pcb, got you covered. If you need something to go on the back (component) side of the PCB; I've provided a range of shapes just in case you happen to have components in the way.

I would suggest that if you are getting these printed, get more than you need printed in case you need to modify the files further.

When using these below the PCB, Take a long hard look at the componentry to make sure the shims are not interfering with anything. Also check after mounting your stabs that no intereference with your case is present. Might be awkward! ðŸ˜„
